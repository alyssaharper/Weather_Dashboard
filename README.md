# Weather_Dashboard

Created a weather dashboard that when you type in a city name, it pulls the daily temperature and several other factors about the weather. It also shows the 5 day forecast for that city.

Once the city has been called, it is pulled from Local Storage and saved as a button for the user to click on as a history.
